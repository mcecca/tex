\note[itemize]{
\item Thanks for being here + coauthors 
\item In this paper we are going to ask a simple question, namely, how do borrowers find their banks? We are going to argue that an important piece of the puzzle is the role played by the individual bankers in facilitating the formation of bank-borrower relationships. 
\item Let me start by providing some anecdotal evidence that bankers do indeed matter and that when they jump ship to a competing bank they take their client portfolio with them.

% BIG PICTURE QUESTION AND MOTIVATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Big picture}
\begin{frame}{Anecdotal evidence}
\centering
  \faQuoteLeft~ [CEO Dan Ariens] approached his lender, LaSalle Bank, to see if it would ramp up his credit line. But LaSalle [\ldots] would never get the additional business. \\ \vspace{.5cm} 
 \onslide<2->{  Ariens, in fact, ended up \textcolor{red}{moving nearly all of his banking relationships to PrivateBancorp.} The Chicago-based bank \textcolor{red}{hired 56 managing directors} in the fourth quarter, \textcolor{red}{most of them from LaSalle}, and posted a 12\% increase in loans compared with the year-ago quarter. \\ \vspace{.5cm} }
 \onslide<3->{  \textbf{\textcolor{red}{ ``It felt natural to stay with the people we knew,'' }} [the CEO] said.~\faQuoteRight \\ \vspace{.5cm} } \hfill  (Chicago Tribune, February 18, 2008) 

   % \faQuoteLeft~ Star bankers are routinely subjected to rough treatment when they jump ship to a rival. [...] Credit Suisse took the war-on-talent to a whole new level when it hired private investigators to tail Iqbal Khan, the bank’s former wealth management chief, \textcolor{red}{fearing he might be poaching talent and stealing business leads} in the days before starting a new job at UBS Group AG, in Zurich.~\faQuoteRight \\ \vspace{.2cm} \hfill  (Fortune, October 1, 2019)
    %The move backfired in spectacular and tragic fashion with the death of a private investigator, the ouster of a top-ranked Credit Suisse official—the CEO’s top lieutenant—and the bank’s reputation in tatters.

  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Motivation and preview of findings 
    \item Data
    \item Empirical findings:
    \begin{wideitemize} 
      \item Which bankers change employers?
      \item Banks profit when new bankers join 
      \item How do labor market friction spill over into capital markets? 
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% MOTIVATION AND PREVIEW
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\textcolor{red}{Lending relationships:} 
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item have a large impact on borrowers, e.g., impacting both the availability (Ioannidou, Ongena (JF, 2010)) and pricing of credit (Khwaja,  Mian (AER, 2008))
  \item are a channel through which shocks to the banking system are transmitted to the real sector (e.g. Chodorow-Reich (QJE, 2014))
\end{wideitemize} \vspace{.3cm}

\begin{center}
How are these relationships formed? \textcolor{red}{How do banks and borrowers actually match?} \\ \vspace{.3cm}
\end{center}

\textcolor{red}{The role of bankers:} 
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item bankers are the source of soft information about borrower (Berger, Udell (EJ, 2002))
  \item hence, they ought to play a \textcolor{red}{key role in matching borrowers to banks}
  \item and frictions in the labor market for bankers have \textcolor{red}{consequences in capital markets}
\end{wideitemize} \vspace{.2cm}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
\item We use a novel dataset that contains detailed information on the connections that a banker develops during her employment at a bank and information about when a banker changes employer.
\item Will talk about data in more detail later, but let me give you a brief overview of the findings for now.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Preview of findings}
\begin{enumerate} 

\item Banks seem to recognize the ability of bankers to bring additional business:
\begin{wideitemize}
    \onslide<2->{ 
      \item Bankers that have \textcolor{red}{more clients} are more likely to get poached by competing banks
     }
\end{wideitemize} \vspace{.2cm}

\onslide<3->{ 
\item Bankers succeed in bringing their previous clients with them at the new bank
\begin{wideitemize}
\onslide<4->{ 
  \item After a commercial banker with an established relationship with a borrower switches to another bank, the \textcolor{red}{likelihood of the borrower following the banker to the new employer increases by 14\%} (ca. 3$\times$  uncond. sample average)
  \item These new client relationships have a \textcolor{red}{significant value for the bank}: Deal volume with these clients increases by 35\%}
\end{wideitemize} \vspace{.2cm}
}

\onslide<5->{ 
\item Frictions in the labor market have spillover effects into capital markets 
\onslide<6->{ 
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item Use gender discrimination lawsuits and absence of female directors as a proxies for less female friendly cultures
  \item Banks with such culture \textcolor{red}{lose female bankers and their clients}
\end{wideitemize}}}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% LITERATURE OVERVIEW
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Literature review I - Role of bankers}
  \textcolor{red}{Bankers play an important role in the lending process}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \onslide<2->{ 
    \item Bushman, Gao, Martin, Pacelli (2019) find that bankers are important in determining loan characteristics, especially covenant design  
    \item Frattaroli, Herpfer (2020) find that bankers help firms identify partners for strategic alliances 
    \item Gao, Kleiner, Pacelli (RFS, 2020) find that bankers that structure poorly performing loans face disciplining consequences
    \item Herpfer (2018) finds that strong relationships between a borrower and a banker significantly reduce interest rates }
  \end{wideitemize}

\onslide<3->{  \vspace{.2cm} \textcolor{red}{Our contribution:} Look at the \textcolor{red}{role of bankers} in \textcolor{red}{relationship lending}}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
  \item Nascent literature that examines the role of bankers in the lending process
  \item Our contribution is to bring together the relationship lending literature and the more recent studies on the role of individual bankers and ask what the impact of individuals is on the formation of relationships between banks and their clients
}

\begin{frame}{Literature review II - Relationship lending}
\textcolor{red}{Relationship lending plays a key role for both banks and firms}
\begin{wideitemize}
    \onslide<2->{ 
     \item The ability of banks to create information about their borrowers is at the core of banking (e.g., Berger and Udell, JofB 1995; Berger and Udell, EJ 2002; Diamond, REStud 1984; Petersen and Rajan, JF 1994) 
     \item The soft information of these relationships is concentrated in individual bankers (Liberti and Petersen, RCFS 2019; Karolyi, JF 2018)
     \item Banking relationships play a key role also for the firms, influencing loan conditions (Ioannidou and Ongena, JF 2010) and availability (Ongena and Smith, JFE 2001)
     }
\end{wideitemize} 

\onslide<3->{ \vspace{.2cm}
      \textcolor{red}{What drives the formation of relationships between firms and banks?} \\ 
      \begin{wideitemize} \item Schwert, JF 2018; Petersen and Rahan, QJE 1995; JF 2002;... look at the importance of bank characteristics for the formation of borrower relationships \end{wideitemize} }

\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
  \item Our paper also relates to the much broader literature that looks at the importance of relationship lending. 
  \item Relationship lending generates soft information that can be used instead of collateral or more generally speaking to monitor borrowers
  \item Berger and Udell, JofB 1995 find that borrowers with relationships pay lower interests and are less likely to pledge collateral 
  \item Petersen and Rajan, JF 1994;  empirically examines how ties between a firm and its creditors affect the availability and cost of funds to the firm ``Relationships are valuable and appear to operate more through quantities rather than prices.''
  \item Karoly JF 2018 - Use executive deaths to show that connections between banks and management make lending more likely

% \section{Conclusion}
% \begin{frame}{Conclusion}
% In sum, bankers appear to be an important piece in explaining the creation of lending relationships. They \textcolor{red}{facilitate the matching} between firms and banks. \\ \vspace{.5cm} 
% \textcolor{red}{Open questions \& next steps:} 
% \begin{wideitemize}
%   \item \textcolor{red}{Identification} - Sources of exogenous variation in the probability of switching, e.g.,  restrictions in labor mobility or drop in bank performance/executive pay 
%   \item Role of \textcolor{red}{bank culture} - Are bankers more likely to leave banks with a ``toxic culture''?
%   \item Role of \textcolor{red}{demographics} - Are female bankers better at forming strong client relationships? Are they more or less likely to switch banks?
