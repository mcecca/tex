%``The $161 billion-asset Citizens has already recruited one team of commercial bankers away from SunTrust, and its top commercial banker said Tuesday that he expects the merger — the industry’s largest in more than a decade — to lead to more banker defections.''
%McCree said Tuesday that Citizens has been adding around 300 new clients every year across its footprint, and it’s done so primarily by hiring local bankers in its newer markets. [...] “They are bringing clients with them, which is one of my goals when I hire people,” he said. McCree is Vice Chairman and Head of Commercial Banking at Citizens

%sp global article poaching clients
%https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/ma-creates-poaching-opportunities-for-commercial-credits
%``Bankers often talk about C&I lending as a relationship-driven business, so an acquisition could force large clients to reconsider their lending partners. Commercial borrowers often select banks for reasons beyond the loan's terms and pricing, valuing institutions that can also deliver cash management, debt syndication or other services.''

%https://www.boyden.com/media/small-regional-banks-find-ease-poaching-large-bank-talent-588520/index.html
%The strategy gives smaller firms a crack at picking off large rivals' clients, says Jeff Davis, senior analyst at FTN Financial, a unit of First Horizon National Corp. (FHN). That's because business customers are notoriously loyal to their bankers.

%WSJ article on banks actively doing this:
%https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323530404578205842980922344
%Jim Schmitz, president of middle Tennessee for Regions, based in Birmingham, intends to add more Nashville bankers at the beginning of 2013. He said he would try to recruit from rival banks if he can find local lenders who can bring "relationships with companies we don't already have."

%CS hired private detective to follow Kahn out of fear he might poach bankers (not clients!)

\frametitle{Banker poaching is not an isolated incident, and consistent with theory}

Banking is a relationship business and banks realize this broadly:

	\textit{``Citizens has been adding around 300 new clients every year across its footprint, and it’s done so primarily by hiring local bankers in its newer markets. [...] They are bringing clients with them, which is one of my goals when I hire people”''}
	\linebreak
	\hspace*{2cm} -Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking at Citizens}

\onslide<2->{
Theory:
    \begin{itemize}
	
	\item The ability of banks to create information about their borrowers is at the core of banking (e.g., Diamond, 1984; Petersen and Rajan, 1994; Berger and Udell, 1995). 
	\item The soft information of these relationships is concentrated in individual bankers (Liberti \& Petersen 2019).

  	\frametitle{Related literature and contribution}
  	       \framesubtitle{We contribute to the nascent literature on the role of bankers for large borrowers and the literature on information flows through capital providers}
  	\begin{itemize}

  		\item Frattaroli \& Herpfer (2020) bankers act as matchmakers between clients
  		\item Gao et al (2020) bankers face career consequences from making loans, Gao et al (2018) bankers can be distracted
		\item Herpfer (2017) shows that individual bankers in the U.S. syndicated loan market obtain significant information about their borrowers
		\item We have a unique advantage because we posses data on bankers working for separate banks and with multiple clients

		\item We show that
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Commercial bankers are a key link between banks and borrowers
			\item After a banker switches to a new employing bank, they bring over their prior clients
			\item These clients do not just come over once, but stay in the long term
			\item clients bring with them not just bank loans but the entire relationship, e.g. bond issuances
			\item Bankers that switch tend to have more, and more deep relationships with clients
