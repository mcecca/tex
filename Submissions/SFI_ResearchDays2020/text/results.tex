\label{sec:initiation}

Some additional data description (fr rest see Table \ref{app:Tables})
\begin{itemize}

	\item deals are defined as any occurrence of (syndicated) loans, SEOs, Bond offerings
	\item initiation is defined as the first occurrence of any type of deal between a bank and a borrower (5 year rolling window to define ``first'')
	\item  strict initiation is initiation but only for borrowers that appear at least once in the data before the first deal
	\item personal relationship acquired is defined as: borrower $i$ took out at least one loan with bankers $b$ working for a lead bank in the past. Banker $b$ then appears on (any) loan contract for bank $c$, but excluding loans to borrower $i$ to avoid mechanical effects. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion and alternative explanations}

Potential issue:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Banks expand in an industry and both hire people and extend lending there
\end{itemize}
